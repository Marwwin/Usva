                    ATTE is a very seasoned wildlife cinematographer and producer
                    with over a decade of experience. And even before this Atte
                    spent his childhood learning the craft from his father whom also
                    is an expert wildlife cinematographer. Atte's strong suits are
                    his incredible nerves of steele and sixth sense of finding wild
                    and rare happenings. His hobbies include wildlife filmmaking,
                    boats, and building and flying racing drones.

                    MAX is a documentary and commercial writer, director who has
                    slowly but determined slided towards wildlife filmmaking,
                    finally settling as co-founder of Usva Films. Transitioning to
                    the wild elements has been easy because Max's most enjoyable
                    work have been working for weeks in end in the jungles of
                    Bolivia and Borneo during previous projects. Combining the hobby
                    of nature and documentary has been love at first sight. Max's
                    strong suits are his imagination and constant search for new
                    ways to solve problems, sometimes even spitting out more
                    solutions than there are problems. Though a more reserved Max
                    carnates when he has had a couple of days in a hide. â€‹
