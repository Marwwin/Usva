            <p>ATTE is a very seasoned wildlife cinematographer and producer with over a decade of experience. 
                And even before this Atte spent his childhood learning the craft from his father whom also is an expert wildlife cinematographer. 
                Atte's strong suits are his incredible nerves of steele and sixth sense of finding wild and rare happenings. 
                His hobbies include wildlife filmmaking, boats, and building and flying racing drones.</p>

            <h2>Max Kujala</h2>
            <img src="./img/max.webp" alt="">
            <p>MAX is a documentary and commercial writer, director who has slowly but determined slided towards wildlife filmmaking, finally settling as co-founder of Usva Films.
                Transitioning to the wild elements has been easy because Max's most enjoyable work have been working for weeks in end in the jungles of Bolivia and Borneo during previous projects.
                Combining the hobby of nature and documentary has been love at first sight.
                Max's strong suits are his imagination and constant search for new ways to solve problems, sometimes even spitting out more solutions than there are problems.
                Though a more reserved Max carnates when he has had a couple of days in a hide.
